## Description

The E-commerce Back End project is a full-stack web development project that simulates a backend for an e-commerce website. The project aims to provide a comprehensive backend solution that allows the user to manage and maintain various aspects of the e-commerce website, such as products, categories, tags, and product tags.

The primary problem that the project aims to solve is to provide a fully functional backend system that enables users to manage and maintain their e-commerce website efficiently. The project provides a seamless integration between the front-end and back-end, allowing the user to easily update and manage the products, categories, tags, and product tags.

To solve the above problem, the project uses various technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL. The use of these technologies provides the project with a robust and scalable backend system that can easily handle large amounts of data. The use of Sequelize allows the project to interact with the database seamlessly, making it easy to create, read, update, and delete data from the database.

Throughout the development process, I learned various concepts such as data modeling, database interaction, and server-side programming. I also learned how to use various technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL, which are essential for building a robust and scalable backend system. Additionally, I learned how to manage and maintain different aspects of an e-commerce website such as products, categories, tags, and product tags.

In conclusion, the E-commerce Back End project provides a robust and scalable backend solution that allows users to manage and maintain various aspects of their e-commerce website efficiently. The project is an excellent example of how to use various technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL to build a robust and scalable backend system. Through this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge about server-side programming, database interaction, and e-commerce website management.
